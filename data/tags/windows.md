Bun provides a *limited*, experimental native builds for [Windows](<https://bun.sh/docs/installation#windows>).  
To install, paste this into your terminal:  
```ps
# WARNING: No stability is guaranteed on the experimental Windows builds
powershell -c "iwr bun.sh/install.ps1|iex"
```

However, it's still recommended to use [WSL](<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install>) for the best experience.
