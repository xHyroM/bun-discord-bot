Bun is a modern JavaScript runtime like Node or Deno. It was built from scratch to focus on three main things:
â€¢ Start fast (it has the edge in mind).
â€¢ New levels of performance (extending JavaScriptCore, the engine).
â€¢ Being a great and complete tool (bundler, transpiler, package manager).

**error: Linux kernel version doesn't support io_uring, which Bun depends on**

To fix this error, you need to update Linux kernel.
If you are using the Windows Subsystem for Linux, do:
  **1.** Open powershell as administrator
  **2.** Run:
     â€¢ wsl --set-version <disto name> 2
       â€¢ If it throws `Please enable the Virtual Machine Platform Windows feature and ensure virtualization is enabled in the BIOS.`, turn on Virtual Machine Platform in Windows Features and then rerun this command.
       â€¢ PS: You can get distro name from `wsl --list -v` 
     â€¢ wsl --update
     â€¢ wsl --shutdown

If that doesn't work (and you're on a Windows machine), try this:
  **1.** Open Windows Update
  **2.** Download any updates to Windows Subsystem for Linux

**Illegal instruction - core dumped**

Bun currently only works on CPUs supporting the AVX2 instruction set.
There is nothing you can do about it at the moment, you can only wait.
However, there are plans to make a build that doesn't need AVX2 ([#67](<https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/issues/67>))

**NOT RECOMMENDED (VERY SLOW ALTERNATIVE)**:
To run on older CPUs this can be emulated using Intel SDE, however bun won't be as fast as it would be when running on CPUs with AVX2 support.
If you get this error while bun is initializing, you probably need to wrap the bun executable with intel-sde.

**1.** Install intel-sde:
   â€¢ Arch Linux: `yay -S intel-sde`
   â€¢ Other Distros:
+++bash
wget https://downloadmirror.intel.com/732268/sde-external-9.7.0-2022-05-09-lin.tar.xz -O /tmp/intel-sde.tar.xz
cd /tmp
tar -xf intel-sde.tar.xz
cd sde-external*
mkdir /usr/local/bin -p
cp sde64 /usr/local/bin/sde
cp -r intel64 /usr/local/bin/
cp -r misc /usr/local/bin/
+++

**2.** Add alias to bashrc
   â€¢ `echo "alias bun='sde -chip-check-disable -- bun'" >> ~/.bashrc`
